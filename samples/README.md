Sample files, meant to exercise all known functionality of the relevant file types.
The files are named after their original filename prefixed by the game they come from.
The exception to this is the `._ch` files, where the name is necessary for inferring information about the file.
Those all come from FC anyway.

Files are copyright Nihon Falcom, obviously.
